This folder contains the This folder contains the Matlab implementations used in computing backward reachable sets presented
in the paper under title "Safe Tracking Control of Discrete-Time Nonlinear Systems Using Backward Reachable Sets" (to be presented in ACC 2024).
The main files to run are Tracking_Dubin_Car and Tracking_Planar_Quadrotor. Note that you need to install the software CORA as it is needed in some zonotopic computations and zonotopic plots.
The file Tracking_Dubin_Car contains several comments that clarify how backward reachable sets are computed.
To generate the plots of the backward reachable sets, you can run the files Plotting_Dubin_Car and Plotting_Planar_Quadrotor.
